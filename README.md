# Budget Sales Analytics

## Problem Statement

Our "Domain Sale" process is structured to help potential buyers purchase the domain they want immediately without the hassle of contacting the seller directly. A seller lists a domain for sale at a specific price in our Marketplace. An interested buyer sees this domain for sale and decides to buy it.

This project aims to extract various information such as sales, budget, and variance, compare sales and budgets with various attributes, and extract necessary information about products and customers. We will create a dashboard with various visualizations to find key metrics and meaningful relationships between attributes.

## Short Description

The primary objective is to gain insights into sales performance, budget adherence, and customer behavior to facilitate informed decision-making in domain sales. This project focuses on analyzing sales trends, budget variances, and customer insights using retail and sales datasets.
